# Niko Speak!

**Niko Speak!** is a simple clicker-type mod for **OneShot: World Machine Edition** that adds a small interactive window with Niko!  
This mod was made to test the functionality of the [WorldMachineLoader](https://github.com/ref-err/WorldMachineLoader) and was inspired by the [Nikospeak](https://github.com/pixel1nova/nikospeak) program by pixel1nova.  
Click the button to hear Niko make a cat sound!  
There is also a click counter at the top right of the window!  

## Installation
Before installing the mod, make sure you have **WorldMachineLoader** installed and launched it at least one time.
1. Download the latest release from Releases page.
2. Copy the `NikoSpeak` folder into your `mods` directory inside the game folder.
3. Launch the mod loader, and the mod should load automatically.
  
Have fun! :3
