# Niko Speak!

**Niko Speak!** is a simple clicker-type mod for **OneShot: World Machine Edition** that adds a small interactive window with Niko!  
This mod was made to test the functionality of the [WorldMachineLoader](https://github.com/ref-err/WorldMachineLoader) and was inspired by the [Nikospeak](https://github.com/pixel1nova/nikospeak) program by pixel1nova.  
Click the button to hear Niko make a cat sound!  
There is also a click counter at the top right of the window!  
Currently, the window pops up when the desktop gets loaded and... You can't close it. You will be stuck with Niko forever.  

## Installation
Before installing the mod, make sure you have **WorldMachineLoader** installed and launched it at least one time.
1. Download the latest release from Releases page.
2. Copy the `NikoSpeak` folder into your `mods` directory inside the game folder.
3. Launch the mod loader, and the mod should load automatically.
  
Have fun! :3
